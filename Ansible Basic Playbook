# One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working on to 
# test an Ansible playbook on jump host. However, he was only 
# able to create the inventory, and due to other priorities 
# that came in he must work on other tasks. Please pick up 
# this task from where he left off and complete it. 
# Below are more details about the task:


# The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory 
# seems to be having some issues; please fix them. 
# The playbook needs to be run on App Server 1 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.

# Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml 
# and add a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 1.

# Note: Validation will try to run playbook using 
# command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml 
# so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
