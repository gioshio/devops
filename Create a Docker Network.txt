The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. 
One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker 
networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:


a. Create a docker network named as official on App Server 1 in Stratos DC.

b. Configure it to use macvlan drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet 10.10.1.0/24 and iprange 10.10.1.1/24.

docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=10.10.1.0/24 --ip-range=10.10.1.1/24 official

sudo docker network ls
sudo docker network inspect official
