There are directory structures in the Stratos Datacenter that need to be changed, including 
directories that need to be linked to the default Apache document root. 
We need to accomplish this task using only Puppet as per the instructions given below:


Create a puppet programming file games.pp under 
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. Within that define a class symlink and perform below mentioned tasks:

Create a symbolic link through puppet programming code. 
The source path should be /opt/devops and destination 
path should be /var/www/html on all Puppet agents i.e on all App Servers.

Create a blank file story.txt under 
/opt/devops directory on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Note: Please perform this task using games.pp only, 
do not create any separate inventory file.




class symlink {
  # First create a symlink to /var/www/html
  file { '/opt/devops':
    ensure => 'link',
    target => '/var/www/html',
  }
  
  # Now create media.txt under /opt/devops
  file { '/opt/devops/story.txt':
    ensure => 'present',
  }
}

node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {
  include symlink
}
